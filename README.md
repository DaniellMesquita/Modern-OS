# Description #

Screens is a Linux/HTML5-based modern, easy, rewardable (what?), beautiful, customizable, powerfull and open-source operating system.
It have a UI based in Electron which controls the system.
Electron Apps, Cordova Apps, Screens Apps (HTML5) and Progressive Web Apps support in plans.

Screens is thought to run either as an app on your current OS, as a service in your browser, as a Linux distro, as an Android ROM or any other platform/device.

You can test Screens, share it or contribute. This isn't hard for those who have knowledge only in HTML/CSS/Javascript languages. Also if you isn't good in programming, here is a good news: Screens' UI (Electron) source-code is a Construct 2 project, so you can program using a visual event sheet!
